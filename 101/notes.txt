Total cumulative seats won by each of the different political parties in Canada ever since the first federal election in 1867 up to the most recent one in 2019.

I decided to merge the seat counts of all parties that, in some way, merged into another party or formed as the successor to another e.g. Conservative Party of Canada(current) includes seats from a) Progressive Party of Canada and b) Canadian Alliance since it was formed by the merge of these two, c) Reform Party, since it was succeeded by Canadian Alliance and d) Conservative Party of Canada (old) since it was succeeded by Progressive Party of Canada (full timeline below).
The names and logos of the parties are as they are currently today.
