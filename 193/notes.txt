Top countries by electricity production [1985 to 2018]

Figures shown are measured in terawatt-hours

This video shows the top countries according to electricity production from 1985 to 2018. BP was used as the primary source for electricity production data and it is worth noting that BP does not provide data for all countries. For countries that BP didn't have electricity data on, Ember was used to supplement the data for that country for that year.
