Top Countries by Openness to Trade

This video compares the countries that are most open to trade from 1960 to 2017.

The comparison is made using a metric called the trade openness index which is calculated by taking the ratio of the sum of exports and imports to the country's GDP. In other words, Trade openness = (Imports + Exports) / GDP. Therefore, the higher the percentage, the more influence trade has over economic activities.
