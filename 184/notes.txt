Top countries by CO₂ consumption per capita [1950 to 2018]

Figures shown are measured in tonnes per person per year

This video shows the top countries according to CO₂ emissions per capita from 1950 to 2018. Each country's share of CO₂ is based on annual national emissions data published by the Global Carbon Project (GCP). This is calculated as each country's share of the sum of all country emissions plus international aviation and shipping ('bunkers') and 'statistical differences'.
