Who we spend our time with according to our age (15 to 80)

In this video, we look at the average time we are likely to spend with others measured in minutes per day. Data collected is recorded by the age of the respondent and based on averages from many surveys collected from 2009 to 2019 within the US.
Note that time spent with multiple people can be counted more than once (e.g. attending a party with friends and spouse counts for both “friends” and “partner”)
