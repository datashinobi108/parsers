COVID-19 global deaths in 2020 vs other communicable diseases

In this video, we look at the total number deaths worldwide caused by COVID-19 and other communicable diseases. A communicable disease is any disease that passes between people or animals and can be caused by pathogens including viruses, bacteria and fungi. I thought it would be interesting to show how COVID-19 ranked among other communicable diseases.

[OC] Comparing COVID-19 global deaths in 2020 vs other communicable diseases

Data is measured in total number of global deaths

In this visualization, I look at the total number of deaths in the world in 2020 caused by COVID-19 and compare that to other communicable diseases. A communicable disease is any disease that passes between people or animals and can be caused by pathogens including viruses, bacteria and fungi.

Data for the other communicable diseases was taken from the Global Burden of Disease Study(which has this data up until 2019) and adjusted for 2020 population.
