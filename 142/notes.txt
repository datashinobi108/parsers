Ranking Countries according to Case Fatality Rate compared to the World

[Updated as of 5th April 2020 at 11.30 ET]

This video ranks countries based on the Case Fatality Rate for people that are infected with COVID-19 since March 1, 2020 up until April 5, 2020. I have also included the world average for comparison.

What is Case Fatality Rate?
Case Fatality Rate (CFR) is the percentage of total confirmed cases that resulted in deaths and can be calculated as follows:
CFR = (total # of deaths / total # of cases) * 100.
As an example, if there are 100 people infected, and 5 of them die, then the CFR is (5/100) * 100 = 5%.
CFR is one of the most utilized metrics to answer the question: 'If I am infected with COVID-19, what are the chances that I will die?'. While it is the most common metric used to answer this question, it does not represent actual chance that a given person will die from the virus for 2 reasons:
1) there are more cases around the world than what is actually reported, this is due to limited testing which varies from country to country
2) there are active cases right now that may still result in death

Comment:
Only countries that have reported more than 100 cases are shown in this video. Was there any country that shocked you the most?
