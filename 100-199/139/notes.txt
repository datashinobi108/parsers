Ranking USA vs China vs Italy vs Spain by Confirmed Cases in the month of March

[Updated as of 31th March 2020 at 11.45 ET]

This video ranks USA, China, Italy and Spain based on the number of cases/people confirmed to have the coronavirus(COVID-19) during the month of March 2020. I specifically chose these countries so that you can see how the number of confirmed cases in USA, Italy and Spain grew to overtake China which is alarming.

The number of reported cases outside of China keeps on rising and we need to practice physical distancing to slow down the rate at which these numbers are increasing.
