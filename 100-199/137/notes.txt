Ranking Countries according to Deaths per Million People

[Updated as of 28th March 2020 at 7.45 ET]

This video ranks countries based on the average number of cases/people confirmed to have died from the coronavirus(COVID-19) per 1 million people since Mar 1, 2020 up until March 28, 2020. The virus has spread to over 170 countries with significant outbreaks in China (where the virus originated), Italy, Spain, USA, Iran and South Korea. I also added in the world average in the animation for comparison.
The number of reported deaths in Europe keeps on rising especially in Italy and Spain, two countries that have overtaken China.

Comment:
I removed San Marino since they are reporting a large number for this metric and hence would not show a good comparison for the rest of the countries. That being said, San Marino reported 29.4655 deaths per million people on March 1st and grew to 618.7754 deaths per million people on March 28th
