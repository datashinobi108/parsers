Coronavirus: Ranking of Total Reported Deaths by Region [26 April 2020]

[Updated as of 26th April 2020 at 8.45 ET]

This video ranks regions based on the number of reported deaths due to the coronavirus(COVID-19) since January 21, 2020 up until April 26, 2020.
We can see that early on, Asia had the highest number of reported deaths, but in the month of March, Europe and North America started to report a huge increase in the number of deaths reported and eventually overtook Asia.
These numbers that are reported are much lower than the actual number of total deaths. The main reason for this is due to limited testing that varies from country to country.
