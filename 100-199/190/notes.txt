Top countries by change in sulphur dioxide emissions [1990 to 2015]

This video shows the top countries according to sulphur dioxide emissions that have been indexed to annual emission levels in 1990. Emission levels are assumed to be 100 so values less that 100 indicate a decrease in emissions, where values above 100 indicate an increase.

The values shown are indexed to the emission levels in 1990 at 100. So if a country has a value like 35 in 2000, this would mean that since 1990, that country reduced its sulphur dioxide emissions by 65% in 20 years.
