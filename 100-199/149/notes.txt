[Updated as of 18th April 2020 at 7.45 ET]

This video shows the top 15 countries according to the number of cases/people confirmed to have the coronavirus(COVID-19) since March 1, 2020 up until April 18, 2020.
The number of confirmed cases is lower than the number of actual total cases. The main reason for this is due to limited testing that varies from country to country.
The virus has spread to 180 countries with significant outbreaks in China (where the virus originated), Italy, Spain, Germany, France and USA.

Comment:
On April 16th of this year, we hit 2 million reported cases worldwide which is alarming, but many countries are starting to show progress in terms of flattening the curve! The rate at which people are getting infected in many countries is beginning to slow down which is a good sign.
