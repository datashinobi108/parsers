Nuclear weapons inventory of nuclear powers (1945-2014)

This video shows the number of nuclear warheads in the inventory of nuclear powers. The number of countries with confirmed nuclear capabilities now includes the US, Russia, UK, France, China, India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea.

It is worth noting that while the number of warheads eventually decreased, the destructive power of each warhead increased significantly.
