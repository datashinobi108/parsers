COVID-19 Pandemic: Ranking Countries according to Reported Coronavirus CPD compared to World Average

[Updated as of 22nd March 2020 at 7.30 ET]

This video shows the top 25 countries according to reported number of coronavirus cases per death(CPD) while comparing it to the world average, over the last month. I only included countries that have reported at least 1 death and at least 250 cases to get a reasonable average.

The values in this video indicate the average number of cases that are reported for a single death eg. For a given country, if the CPD value is 80 then that means there are 80 cases reported before a death occurs which is a percentage of 1.25% (1.25% of all reported cases resulted in deaths)

Please note that the values shown in this video do not reflect the real numbers as there are discrepancies when it comes to how many cases and deaths are being reported. Hope everyone is keeping safe and sanitary.
